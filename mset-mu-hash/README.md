The code in this crate was heavily inspired by https://cronokirby.com/posts/2021/07/on_multi_set_hashing/ 's blog and the associated source code. The source code linked in the repo is under the MIT License,
meaning the mset-mu-hash, based on this paper (📝 : http://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/pubs/mhashes.pdf) is also under the MIT License. 

The slight changes made to the code were done mainly to account for the breaking backward-compatibility update made by the https://github.com/RustCrypto crate owners.
